the ambience be pretty and nice for conversation so a casual lunch here would probably be good,1
though the service could be well possibly due to more than one very large group in the house it be very cordial and warm as be the general clientele,0
overprice for the service,-1
the wait staff be pleasant fun and for the most part gorgeous in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way not in that she s way cut than i that b way,1

i ask for they spicy and they be delicious,1

after pass by this restaurant for sometime i finally decide to go in and have dinner,0
we will n t go to this place again for a good meal,-1
we order some beef and noodle soup dish from the thai section of the menu but nothing we get be thai,-1
i would say that all be fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can n t not mention or undermine,-1

the crust be imazingly cook well and pizza be fully load,1
we have a good time,1
i would never recommend this place to anybody even for a casual dinner,-1
good service and friendly staff,1
however it s the service that leave a bad taste in my mouth,-1
very pleasant stay at this hotel,1
the hotel be new and nicely design however it doesn t have such a hostel atmosphere,0
the food be fresh delicious and reasonably price,1
it can not be the ambience because the place be very cramped and some guest have to sit in an aisle,-1
the hotel have free parking and be near a subway station that bring you straight to the city center,0
köln be really worth visit and the dorint a very comfortable place to stay,1
as the hotel be only build a few year ago it be not run down at all and be very modern,1
only there for one night so can not comment on long stay but usual expect feature but possible tired for a hotel with high expectation,0
always great service,1
by far the good salad i have have in a fast food restaurant,1

super hotel perfect service poor beach,1
breakfast be very good dinner be excellent,1
we both opt for a pasta dish and they be serve timely and fresh,1
the food be great and they have a good selecion of wine at reasonable price,1

they be the good bagel i have have,1
the price and ambience be especially great consider it be in the west village,1
waitstaff be great very attentive,1
while this can hardly be call a restaurant it be possibly the good deal in manhatten for a plate heap with rice and entree,1
the pizza be yummy and i like the atmoshpere,1
in term of the food itself nothing special we limit ourselves to several appetizer,0
the hostess be very pleasant,1
just because it s cheap do not mean the portion be small or the food be nasty it be great,1
the food always taste fresh and serve promptly,1
their bagel be fine but they be a little overcooked and not really a special bagel experience,-1
it just be nt thai,0

room be good but the restaurant specially the main restaurant the menu ls everytime same child pool be to cold a la carte restaurant l very good maxxiland be really good for the child and for we,0
the location be in a nice safe quiet street close to a supermarket and the bus stop,0
the ambience be so fun and the price be great on top of the fact that the food be really tasty,1
for the price you can not eat this well in manhattan,1
the hostess and the waitress be incredibly rude and do everything they could to rush we out,-1
the service be really top of the line and room be renovate in a very classy but modern style,1
the pizza be pretty good and huge,1
relaxing friendly,1
and affordable,0
unfortunately the food be not something to get work up about,-1

the wine and cheese plate be plentiful and ca nt wait to try the fondue or table grilling,1

the sushi be also great,1
the food be very good for it s price well than most fry dumpling i have have,1
i would definitely recommend sea if you like thai cuisine,1
well position for city sightseeing and well connect easy access to airport with metro,0
i have be to sapphire twice and both time the food be fine if not good,0
it be obvious that no one in the restaurant have any idea about or experience with japanese cuisine,-1
i must warn the reader that the portion size be very small especially the appetizer so if you plan to eat until you be full and do not intend to order the chef s special tasting menu prepare to order and pay for an appetizer dish for each person because the portion be not for sharing a main entree and the cold udon at the end of the meal,-1
food awesome,1
we visit at least once a month,0
my friend get the mushroom pizza which taste well,1
nice hotel with a friendly and helpful staff but very small room,0
although we stay at a very busy time the last few day of octoberfest the staff pay attention to detail and we feel very welcome,1
it s all about the food,1
we will not go to this place again for a good meal,-1
the food be as good as ever,1
for the quality of food a little too expensive,-1
i ve enjoy of the dish we ve order with the only exception be the occasional too authentic for i dish i m a daring eater but not that daring,1
only wine and beer be serve but the house varitie be actually quite good,0
brilliant holiday except from the food the food be diabolical,-1
i be no food critic but i would like to think i have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having live in ny for the last year,0
melia be the good hotel,1
the food serve in small taste portion as an option be very good with each dish be well than the next,1

the pizza be deliver cold and the cheese be n t even fully melt,-1
food be excellent,1
the salad be delicious both refreshing and very spicy,1
great price for weekday stay,0
by far the good pizza in manhattan,1
the real problem i have with this place be the complete lack of service,-1
great place to go for a drink too because they have kind of beer,1
nevertheless because of its good location aside the liverpool one shopping centre with a lot of bar and restaurant i continue go there when travel to liverpool,0
although be warn their dinner menu to sit and take out price be different,0
but after last night spice grill be the only place i m eat indian cuisine,1
after hear a lot of great thing about the restaurant and pass by it on a daily basis we decide to try,0
it be definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone,-1
the first time i go and be completely take by the live jazz band and atmosphere i order the lobster cobb salad,1
the food be bland oily,-1
also specify if you like your food spicy it rather bland if you do nt,-1
excellent location for this stylish hotel,1
service be average,0
the food be great,1
so same price as cheap hotel crappy room food be horrible we leave it and go into town for food no night rest and a few euro damage on motorbike,-1
their wine by the glass be a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with wine for under,1
breakfast be standard more or less the same you can find in any business hotel,0
so i decide to report back to the waitress because it be completely inedible,-1
but when you be seat the waitress be great they explain everything on the menu and the price of the food be really cheap for the service you get,1
the only fallback on this restaurant be the price,-1
the food be very expensive we spend for lunch for two but extremely tasty,1
the place s decor and hide bathroom make for a good laugh,0
nice affordable hotel,1
but hey there be anything well with a decent vegetarian selection in astoria,0

when check in and out the staff be very friendly,1
we usually just get some of the dinner special and they be very reasonably price and very tasty,1
breakfast be basic however tasteful,0

on our last visit they skip over our name on the list leave we wait an extra hour for a table,-1
always fresh and delicious,1
it be totally overpriced fish and chip be about,-1
the lamb be tender so full of flavor the dessert be divine,1
if i could rate the people this place would be off the chart unfortunately the pizza sorry not the good in nyc,-1
not one of our meal be edible bland and or make with weird rosemary or orange flavoring,-1
the cafe itself be really nice with comfortable outdoor chair and table but the service could have be well,0
for year they have put out the most tasty most delicious food and keep it that way,1
wonderful at holiday time,1
tho hotel it s self be okay,0
there be little restaurant in the area but they be extremely overpriced,-1
the red curry be weak and tasteless the pad thai be stick together and lumpy the rice be often overcooked and the seafood be pretty sketchy,-1

we be tell that they be book solid and no other table be available,-1
not only be the cuisine the good around the service have always be attentive and charming,1
on the day i have be in a number of meeting so when come back i do appreciate that the hotel be quiet and offer a restaurant which have a great selection of different food,1
i would recommend this product,1

one thing that could have be well be the food could be more of variety or a choice of local food,0

however service be as plain as sesame crust salmon i have,0
planet thailand have always be a hit with i i go there usually for the sushi which be great the thai food be excellent too,1

i have eat at saul many time the food be always consistently outrageously good,1
a large hotel with mostly business folk come and go,0
the lobster sandwich be and although it be good it be not nearly enough to warrant that price,-1
it just a fun place to go not a five star restaraunt,0
the first time the sushi be outstanding the second time it be a little bland,0
great hotel directly on the strip,1
planet thai be great,1
i heartily recommend,1
it be pretty inexpensive too,0
also cleanliness be not the hotel s good side the carpet be always dirty,-1
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere,1
if you book a five star resort you at least expect a quite and clean room,1

sensational locate superfriendly hotel,1
price be high but the food be good so i would come back again,0
i ve be to at cafe spice probably time it be probably still the good indian restaurant around union square,1

i have be about time and have always have a great meal,1
everything be always cook to perfection the service be excellent the decor cool and understated,1

if you venture off the island of manhattan and can n t seem to find a great italian restaurant drive to corona,1
good food,1
the selection change frequently but the basic dish be always available,0
big hotel area for nearby guest,0
an alright hotel to stay for a night and explore the city but if you need to stay long there be probably well option,0
have appetizer entree and coke and the bill be not include tip,0
i would certainly stay here again,1
over the year it have always provide a pleasurable dining experience with quality food and wine,1
waiter be slow but sweet,0
amazing hotel,1
our stay be a real pleasure and we be look forward to come again we book already once your hotel and we make a mistake in the book day and we realise only the day before our leaving at home that the period we teach we have book have already pass by so we be very glad that this time every thing be get out well,1

as i make the title it be an affordable restaurant for great taste,1
a very pleasant place,1
they have the good dessert and mix drink as well as snack food,1
clean nice friendly polite people,0
among all of the new th avenue restaurant this offer by far one of the good value for your money,1
appetizer take nearly an hour,-1

with the exception of our lemon salad that have so much pepper on it that our eye start water the food here be decent not great,-1
service friendly and attentive,1
they offer the same menu but have creative drink that be load with alcohol and cheeky name but they do cost you,1
we have pass night at the hotel and it s main advantage be the very central location just near the great wheel and the bridge,1
the buffet have a nice selection,0
the only miss thing be a hotel lounge where you can sit and relax or read a paper,0
their sushi kamikaze and other roll be fresh and well present,1
if you like the food and the value you get from some of chinatown restaurant this be not the place for you,-1
i can recommend this hotel,1
the price can not be beat for the quality quantity freshness and taste,1
i have not eat a lamb chop as delicious as that the salad be really nice dress with lemon and extra virgnin olive oil,1

it a little out of the way if you do nt live in the neighborhood but definitely worth the trip from wherever you be,1
the service be excellent the decor be great and the food be delicious and come in large portion,1

i definitely would n t go back,-1
the staff be amazing they make the whole holiday and even to the point where we extend our stay,1
we live in new jersey and whenever we go into new york city we buy bagel to eat hot and then to freeze they tell i that if i call in the order they would bring it out to the car so i would nt have to look for parking,0
i know i should expect small room but in reality it be very tiny,-1
be surprisingly disappointed,-1
the pizza be delicious and the proprietor be one of the nice in nyc,1
very nice hotel very nice room with maisonette,0
great sushi experience,1
for glass of champagne not too expensive bottle of wine and after dinner drink,0
thoroughly enjoyable holiday,1
hope to see you and this great place again,1
over all the look of the place exceed the actual meal,-1
the entertainment be great they have show that go on through out the dinner,1
even though the price be decent for paris i would not recommend this hotel,-1
the hotel room be excellent and the bathroom be large very clean the food have such a variety,1
go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience,0
simply some good taste chinese food at incredible price,1
there be good patisserie and brasserie nearby so we skip the hotel breakfast,0
every time in new york i make it a point to visit restaurant saul on smith street,1
the pad thai lad nar and various other dish all look good on paper but i have have well thai food in less asthetically pleasing place,-1

great spot whether look for a couple of drink or quiet dinner,1
if you love seafood you would love this place,1
the hotel be work together with diffrent restaurant in the city of woerden,0
star hotel with easy access and good location to frankfurt airport,1
unless you be eat in the pizzeria side of this place and be not in a rush this place be a bad idea,-1
there be a lot of restaurant and bar on the territory of hotel,0
service be prompt and courteous,1
the decor however seem to be the distraction so you will n t notice that you just pay buck for some cold eggplant that take frickin hour to come,-1
a little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite,0
in the hotel itself you will find nice restaurant and very good food,1
the atmosphere be crowded but it be a great bistro type vibe,1
i can not imagine a friendly staff work in a restaurant,1
the garlic mash potato be hand down the good in the city,1
those roll be big but not good and sashimi be nt fresh,-1
